# BSC Developer Ecosystem

A guide to available tools, components, and platforms for developing applications on BSC.

This list was forked from [ConsenSys](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list), and we verified most of the parts on BSC.
We hope both new and experienced blockchain developers can benefit from this list.

## Contributions are welcome!

Feel free to submit a pull request, with anything from small fixes to tools you'd like to add (or remove!). If adding a new tool, please add a **brief description** that you think new developers would understand.

- Projects that do not have a working product will not be added.
- Projects that are deprecated or no longer maintained will be removed.
- Projects that are paid/restricted services without open source code or developer reviews will be further vetted.
